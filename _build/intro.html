The application continuously monitors and adjusts the vertical and horizontal position of two servos based on the location of faces in a frame. If a face is detected, then the activity is logged and a notification SMS is sent to the administrator using Amazon Web Services (AWS) API Gateway, Lambda, and Simple Notification Services (SNS). This project expands on the <strong><a href="https://github.com/opencv/open_model_zoo/tree/master/demos/python_demos/face_recognition_demo">face recognition demo</a></strong> found in the OpenCV open model zoo.</p>
