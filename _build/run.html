<h1 id="Running-walle-ng-on-Raspberry-Pi">Running walle-ng on Raspberry Pi<a class="anchor-link" href="#Running-walle-ng-on-Raspberry-Pi"> </a></h1><p>For headless installs that implement systemd, apply power and the walle-ng device should automatically start tracking faces and sending notifications. Things to consider if using headless are 1) make sure to have your images set in the <code>dataset</code> directory and 2) to validate the device is running ssh to the Pi and run <code>sudo systemctl status walled</code>. To start and stop the service, issue <code>sudo systemctl stop walled</code> or <code>sudo systemctl start walled</code>.</p>
<p>For installations that intend on using the Desktop GUI, then starting the application can be done by opening a terminal and executing <code>cd Walle-ng &amp;&amp; python3 wally-ng.py</code>. To quit running the application, place focus on the window that contains the video and press the <code>q</code> button. Things to consider are 1) make sure to have your images set in the <code>dataset</code> directory and 2) you must login to the Pi Desktop in order to view the output of the video stream.</p>

<p>As an alternative to logging into the Pi desktop, you can use SSH on your host computer and run the following commands to view stream:</p>
